Guitar String Tension Calculator

String tension calculator, programmed with NiceGUI interface. Review multiple guitars at once on a plot, up to 9 strings for each guitar. Multiscale is supported if fret fan is known. Currently just D'Addario NYXL strings are in the database, with more to come. 

Heavily inspired by the excellent calculator at https://rodrigocfd.github.io/string-tension-calc/ Go check it out!

Known issues: 
* Deleting a guitar sometimes causes an error if used excessively. Use with caution. 
* Unit changes after data input will calculate tension correctly, however the unit text by the results only updates when a new guitar is added. A clumsy solution is availble but commented out at the moment (see lines 122 and 123)
