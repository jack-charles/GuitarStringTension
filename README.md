Guitar String Tension Calculator

String tension calculator, programmed in NiceGUI. Review multiple guitars at once on a plot, up to 9 strings for each guitar. Multiscale is supported if fret fan is known. Currently just D'Addario NYXL strings are in the database, with more to come. Currently Deleting a guitar is sometimes a little messy, so use with caution.

Heavily inspired by the excellent calculator at https://rodrigocfd.github.io/string-tension-calc/ Go check it out!
